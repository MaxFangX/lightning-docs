### Overview

This page is for those seeking to develop on LND or enhance their conceptual
understanding of the Lightning Network and associated technologies. It is not
comprehensive, but a careful study of the materials below should be sufficient
for anyone's needs.

If something important is missing, or you feel that additional resources or
links would be helpful, please email [Max
Fang](mailto:max@lightning.engineering) or message him on the Lightning
Community Slack.
